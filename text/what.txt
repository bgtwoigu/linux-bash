Anywhere you are, I am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
Anytime you whisper my name
You'll see

How every single promise I'll keep
'Cause what kind of guy would I be
If I was to leave
When you need me most?

What are words
If you really don't mean them when you say them?
What are words
If they're only for good times, then they don't?

4-6
When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, they never go away
They live on, even when we're gone

And I know an angel was sent
Just for me and I know I'm meant
To be where I am
And I'm gonna be

Standing right beside her tonight
And I'm gonna be by your side
I would never leave
When she needs me most

Forever more
