          FADE IN:
          
          In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
          is Evey.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    "Remember, remember, the fifth of
                    November, the gunpowder treason and
                    plot.  I know of now reason why the
                    gunpowder treason should ever be
                    forgot."
          
          Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
          deep centered peace that we can feel.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)

                    Those were almost the very first
                    words he spoke to me and, in a way,
                    that is where this story began,
                    four hundred years ago, in a cellar
                    beneath the Houses of Parliament.
          
          In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
          man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
          stacked with barrels of gunpowder.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
                    blow up the Houses of Parliament.
          
          The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
          cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
          dogs.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    He was caught in the cellars with
                    enough gunpowder to level most of
                    London.

          
          Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
          the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
          of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I wonder where we would
                    be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
                    if it would have mattered.
          
          In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I suppose the answer is in the
                    rhyme.  More than the man, what we
                    must remember is the plot itself.
          

          The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
          looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
          staring up at him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    For in the plot we find more than
                    just a man, we find the idea of
                    that man, the spirit of that man,
                    and that is what we must never
                    forget.
          
          The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
          down her face.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    This, then, is the story of that
                    idea, of that spirit that began
                    with an anarchist's plot four
                    hundred years ago.
          
          Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red
          morning sun.

          
                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          A young Evey sits on her father's lap, combing her Barbie's
          hair.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I was born near the end of the
                    millennium, the year 1997.  My
                    father used to say that people were
                    so afraid that the world was going
                    to end that they were willing it to
                    happen.

          
          Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch,
          watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is
          bad.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't remember much of the
                    century's turn.  I don't remember
                    the market crash or the plague or
                    any of the Trafalgar riots.
          
          The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers
          fighting in a shelled city.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I've read about them since but I
                    don't recall how any of them
                    impacted my life except for the
                    fear.  They would hide it from me,
                    like a secret between them.
          

          Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They
          take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But I could feel it.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          It is a new day.  People are gathered along the street as if
          they were waiting for a parade.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Of the chaos that seemed to swallow
                    the beginning of the 21st century,
                    there is one thing I do remember.

          
          Evey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming,
          she can hear it.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Very clearly, I can remember that
                    sound.
          
          We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And I remember those boots, black
                    leather that gleamed bright in the
                    morning sun.  I had never seen such
                    boots.  All moving in perfect
                    unison.
          

          Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her
          father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with
          military precision.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          In the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party
          calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her
          father's shoulders.
          
          Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.
          
                              DASCOMBE
                    The time has come, London, to
                    return to a bygone age, an age of
                    tradition, an age of values that
                    have been disparaged and all but
                    forgotten.  What this country needs
                    is a leader!  A true leader to
                    remind us of that age.  A righteous
                    leader with the strength of his
                    moral convictions to do what must
                    be done.  I give you that man!  I
                    give you our leader!  Adam Susan!
          

          Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks
          at her mother and again they clasp hands.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It must have seemed so easy to
                    them.  They offered such a simple
                    deal; give up control and we will
                    restore order.
          
          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE
          
          Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    At first, the arrests were
                    political.  Dissidents.  Radicals. 
                    Liberals.

          
          A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    When my parents were younger, they
                    had been activists.  They had
                    marched with Labor in the great
                    train strike.
          
          The sound of heavy boots swarms through the house.
          
                              LITTLE EVEY
                    Mommy?
          

          Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier
          scoops her up.
          
          She is carried through the dark house which is filled with
          soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her
          parents being bound with plastic zip-ties.
          
                              MOTHER
                    My daughter!  Don't take my
                    daughter!
          
                              FATHER
                    Evey!  Evey!
          
                              LITTLE EVEY

                    Mommy!  Daddy!
          
          A heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads
          as Evey is carried out of the house.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I never saw them again.  Overnight,
                    my life, my entire world was
                    erased.
          
          INT.  BATHROOM
          
          A nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as Evey and
          several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory
          bathroom.
          

                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    It was done so quickly and
                    violently, so completely, that it
                    began to seem that it had never
                    even existed.
          
          A tear rolls down Little Evey's cheek.
          
          EXT.  HOUSE
          
          A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home. 
          Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    The homosexuals were next.  What
                    God had started with AIDS had to be
                    finished by man.  It was God's
                    work.  That's what we were told.

          
          He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and
          bloody.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    But once they were gone, there was
                    someone else.  Someone different.
          
          In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting
          Pakistanis.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Someone dangerous.
          

          In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged
          van so tightly they are unable to move.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    There were those who understood
                    what was happening, who knew it was
                    wrong but who kept silent.
          
          A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls
          away.  When he looks up, another man in a military uniform
          whose name is Almond is watching him.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    And in the vacuum of that silence,
                    order was imposed.
          
          Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.

          
          EXT.  STREET
          
          Again, we see the marching boots.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    Order that was like those boots,
                    order that required rigorous
                    discipline.  Order that is exactly
                    the same, where each single step
                    falls with every step.  The order
                    of the many shaped into one.
          
          We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall
          where a poster has been plastered up.  The poster reads,
          "Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith."
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)

                    Somehow in my heart, I knew it
                    wouldn't last.
          
          As the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the
          sign.
          
          After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    What they thought they had crushed,
                    the spirit they believed trampled
                    and ground beneath the marching of
                    their boots, rose up, rose as if
                    from a four hundred year old grave,
                    rose to remind us all that day.
          
          The shadow sprays a "V" over the poster.
          

                                                          FADE OUT.
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Close on a loudspeaker.  There is one on every major street
          corner.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Good evening, London.  It's nine
                    o'clock, the fourth of November in
                    the year 2019 and this is the voice
                    of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
                    of the medium wave.
          
          Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
          "For your protection."
          

          Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
          insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
          girl pedal her bicycle.  The little girl glances nervously
          over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    People of London, be advised --
          
          EXT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          There is a radio on a small makeup table.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    -- that Braxton and Streathon are
                    quarantine zones as of today.

          
          Evey is now a young woman.  She slips into a dress that is
          little more than a nightgown.  She tries to adjust it,
          pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin
          shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a
          lamppost.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    It is suggested that these area be
                    avoided for reasons of health and
                    safety.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          Another radio in a room that seems to be of another world.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)

                    Good news following the
                    productivity reports from
                    Herefordshire indicating a possible
                    end to meat rationing starting mid
                    February.
          
          A man enters the room as he once entered the world.  His body
          is lean and strong and though we do not see his face, there
          is a strength in his carriage, a power to his presence.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          She packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels
          that are too big for her.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Police raided seventeen homes in
                    the Birmingham area, uncovering
                    what is believed to be a major
                    terrorist ring.
          

          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of
          black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is
          like something from the masquerade ball of another era.  It
          has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile,
          forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    Twenty eight people, eight of them
                    women, are currently in detention
                    awaiting trial.
          
          INT.  EVEY'S APARTMENT
          
          Evey coats her lips with a lascivious red.  She stares into
          the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.
          

                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And that is the face of London
                    tonight.
          
          INT.  SHADOW GALLERY
          
          The man, now fully dressed in cloak, hat, and mask gazes into
          the mirror.
          
          This is V.
          
                              FATE (V.O.)
                    And this is the voice of Fate
                    signing off and bidding you a
                    pleasant evening.

          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on Evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she
          walks down a dark cobblestoned street.
          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Close on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that
          it seems they are walking towards each other.
          
                              EVEY (V.O.)
                    I don't know what brought us
                    together that night.  I had never
                    been to that part of Westminster
                    but ever since I've known him, I've
                    stopped believing in coincidence.

          
          EXT.  CITY STREET
          
          Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.
          
                              EVEY
                    Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me,
                    Mister?
          
          The man turns around.  It is not V.
          
                              EVEY

                    Would you like... uh, would you
                    like to sleep with me?
          
          He smiles.
          
                              EVEY
                    I mean, for money.
          
                              MAN
                    That is the clumsiest bit of
                    propositioning I've ever heard.
          
                              EVEY

                    Oh god, I'm sorry.
          
                              MAN
                    Is this your first time, darling?
          
                              EVEY
                    Yes, no, I mean for money.  But I
                    know what you want and I'll do it.
          
          She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and
          her woman's mouth.
