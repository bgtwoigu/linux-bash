段落一：初遇 
　　这段对话是V初遇Evey时发生的，V在自我介绍中使用了47个V打头的单词，语言的优美巧妙，令人惊叹。 
　　 
　　E- Who are you? 
　　V- Who?Who is but the form following the function of what...and what I am is a man in a mask. 
　　E- Oh, I can see that. 
　　V- Of course you can.I'm not questioning your powers of observation.I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is. 
　　E- Right. 
　　V- But on this most auspicious of nights...permit me then, in lieu of the more commonplace sobriquet...to suggest the character of this dramatis persona.Voilà!In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of 
　　 fate.This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...is a vestige of the vox populi,now vacant, vanished.However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified...and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.The only verdict is vengeance,a vendetta...held as a votive not in vain,for the value and veracity of such...shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose.So let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you...and you may call me V 
　　E- Are you, like, a crazy person? 
　　V- I am quite sure they will say so.But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking? 
　　E- I'm Evey. 
　　V- Evey?E-vey. Of course you are. 
　　E- What does that mean? 
　　V- It means that I, like God...do not play with dice and do not believe in coincidence. 
　　 

 
　　我的翻译： 
　　E-你是谁？ 
　　V-谁？“谁”只是代表了一个人罢了，而我这个人，如你所见，是个戴面具的男人。 
　　E-这我看得出。 
　　V-当然你看得出，我不是质疑你的观察力，只是指出你问一个戴面具的人他是谁，有点矛盾。 
　　E-也对。 
　　V-但是在这个特别的夜晚，允许我，抛弃那些不入流的假名……来介绍真正的主角。就这样！如你所见，我是一位卑微的戏子……在命运的摆弄下既扮演受害者又扮演施暴者。这面具，不仅仅是虚假的外表，而是人民呼声的残迹，那呼声已经渐渐虚弱，快要消失。但是，过去罪孽引来的天惩即将降临，誓言要诛杀那些腐臭堕落的寄生虫……把审判降临于罪与贪婪。唯一的判决将是复仇，仇杀……这报复绝非徒劳，它的意义就在于维护正直与善良。这浆糊般的废话确实太过冗长，那么让我再补充一句，认识你是我的荣幸……你可以叫我；V。 
　　E-你……是个疯子吗？ 
　　V-我想大多数人都会这么认为，但是，请问，我在和谁说话？ 
　　E-我的名字是Evey。 
　　V-Evey？E-vey。当然 
　　E-这话什么意思？ 
　　V-意思是我，如同上帝一样，不玩掷筛子的游戏也不相信巧合。 
　　 
　　
 
　　段落二：演讲 
　　这段话是V发表的电视演讲，作为自由主义的宣言，它影射了我们这个时代的危机，再次告诫人们：永远不要放弃自由！ 
　　Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine,the security of the familiar,the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration. Whereby important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful, bloody struggle are celebrated with a nice holiday. I thought we could mark this November the 5th a day that is, sadly,no longer remembered by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are, of course,those who do not want us to speak. Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning and, for those who will listen,the enunciation of truth. And the truth is ：there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice,intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object to think and speak as you saw fit， you now have censors and surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting submission.  
　　How did this happen? Who's to blame?Certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. And they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told,if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.  
　　Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler. He promised you order,he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.  Last night, I sought to end that silence. Last night,I destroyed the Old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than 400 years ago, a great citizen wished to imbed the 5th of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice and freedom are more than words. They are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing ,if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you,then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see ,if you feel as I feel,and if you would seek as I seek,then I ask you to stand beside me,one year from tonight,outside the gates of Parliament. And together, we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgot.  
 
　　我的翻译： 
　　晚安，伦敦。首先，请允许我为这样的打扰而道歉。我，和你们一样，喜欢每日安定稳固带来的舒适，熟悉不变带来的安全，和循环往复带来的宁静。我享受这些，就如同所有的凡人。但是，本着铭记和悼念，我想问问：为何历史上通常伴随着死亡或者痛苦折磨的大事要用欢乐的庆典来纪念？（指阴谋的纪念日）我认为我们可以悲哀地说，11月5日，人们不再抽出时间，坐下来，以自由的交谈来把它纪念。当然，有些人，不想让我们谈，实际上，现在就已经有人在电话中叫喊着命令，士兵们已经出发在路上。为什么？因为虽然警棍的暴虐取代了谈话的公正，语言，依然有着力量！这些语言对于有心人来说，是真相的阐明，而真相就是：这个国家大大的不对头了，难道不是吗？残酷与不公，歧视与压迫，从前能够自由地反对、自由地思考、自由地说出真实想法的国家，现在却成了审查和监视的国度，要求你的绝对一致和服从。 
　　 
　　这一切是怎么发生的？这都要怪谁？当然有些人要负起责任而他们也会被惩罚，但是，再一次我们说出真话：如果你们要找那个真正负责的人，只需要看着镜子就可以了。我知道你们为什么这么做，我知道你们被吓坏了，谁不害怕呢？战争、恐怖主义、瘟疫，可怕的问题像金字塔一样垒得高高，共同侵蚀了你的理性和常识，恐惧是控制你们的最好方法。然后，当你们惊恐异常之时，投入了最高元首亚当?苏特勒的怀抱。他向你们陈诺了秩序、和平，他要的回报仅仅是你们的沉默和服从。昨夜，我结束了这种沉默，我炸毁了最高法院来提醒这个国家它忘记了什么！４００多年以前，一个伟大的公民试图把１１月５日永远铭刻在我们的记忆中，他希望提醒这个世界：平等、公正和自由不是泛泛之谈，而是高耸的灯塔。所以如果，你什么也没看到，如果，你始终无视这个政府的罪行，我建议你让１１月５日就这样平淡溜走。但是如果你看到了我所看到的，如果你感到了我所感到的，如果你追寻我所追寻的，那么，我请你在明年的１１月５日的夜晚，在议会的大门外，与我肩并肩站在一起，一起给他们，一个永远永远也不能忘记的，１１月５日！ 

 
Hello, Neo.  
Who are you? I am the Architect. 
I created the Matrix.  I've been waiting for you. 
You have many questions.  Though the process has altered your consciousness. . . 
. . . you remain irrevocably human.  
Ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not.  
Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent. . .  
. . . you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant. 
Why am I here?
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation. . . 
. . . inherent to the programming of the Matrix.  
You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts. . . 
. . . I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise. . .  
. . . a harmony of mathematical precision. 
While it remains a burden assiduously avoided. . .  
. . . it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control. . . 
. . . which has led you, inexorably. . . 
. . . here.  
You haven't answered my question.  Quite right. 
Interesting.  That was quicker than the others. 
Others? How many? What others?
The Matrix is older than you know.  . . . 
I count from the emergence of one integral. . . . . . 
. . . anomaly to the emergence of the next. 
In which case, this is the sixth version.  
Five before me? He's lying.  Bullshit.  
There are only two possible explanations.  There were five before me. 
Either no one told me. . .  
. . . or no one knows.  Precisely. 
As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic. . .  
. . . creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  
You can't control me! I'm gonna smash you to bits!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!.  
You can't make me do anything.  You old, white prick!
Choice. 
The problem is choice.  
The first Matrix I designed was naturally perfect, a work of art. 
Flawless, sublime. 
A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. 
The inevitability of its doom is apparent now. . . 
. . . as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human. 
Thus, I redesigned it based on your history. . . 
. . . to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. 
However, I was again frustrated by failure. 
I have come to understand that the answer eluded me. . . 
. . . because it required a lesser mind. 
Or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.  
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program. . .  
. . . initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.  
If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.  
The Oracle.  Please.  
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby  percent of subjects. . .  
. . . accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice. . .  
. . . even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.  
While this answer functioned, it was fundamentally flawed. . . 
. . . thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly. . .  
. . . that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system.  
Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked. . . 
. . . would constitute an escalating probability of disaster. 
This is about Zion. 
You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. 
Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated. 
Bullshit. 
Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. 
But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it. . . 
. . . and we have become exceedingly efficient at it. 
The function of the One. . .  
. . . is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination of the code you carry. . . 
. . . reinserting the prime program.  
After which you will be required to select from the Matrix  individuals. . . 
. . . sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion. 
Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash. . . 
. . . killing everyone connected to the Matrix. . . 
. . . which, coupled with the extermination of Zion. . . 
. . . will result in the extinction of the entire human race.  
You won't let it happen.  You can't.  You need human beings to survive. 
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. 
The relevant issue is whether or not you are ready. . . 
. . . to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world. 
It is interesting reading your reactions. 
Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication. . . 
. . . a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment. . . 
. . . to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One. 
While the others experience this in a general way. . . 
. . . your experience is far more specific. . . 
. . . vis-? vis love. 
Trinity! 
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own. 
No. 
Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw. . .  
. . . is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed. . . 
. . . as both beginning and end. 
There are two doors. 
The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion.  
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and the end of your species. 
As you adequately put, the problem is choice. 
But we already know what you are going to do, don't we?
Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal. . .  
. . . the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.  
An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:
She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it. 
Hope.  It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously. . .  
. . . the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.  
If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again. 
We won't.
